# Publications

Welcome to our publications page, where we showcase the main contributions of our research team in the fields of Immunology, Immunosenescence, and Leishmaniasis. Our work focuses on understanding the complex interactions between the immune system and infectious diseases, with a particular emphasis on aging and immune system changes during the infectious process. Through rigorous scientific inquiry, we aim to uncover novel insights that could lead to better therapeutic strategies for age-related immune decline and infectious diseases like leishmaniasis. 

Below, you will find a curated list of our most significant publications, reflecting the depth and impact of our ongoing research in these critical areas of study.
